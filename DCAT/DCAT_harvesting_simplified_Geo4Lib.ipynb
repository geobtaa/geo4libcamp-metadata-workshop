    "The Big Ten Academic Alliance Geoportal project uses a more complex version of this script to keep track of changes to the publicly available data that are included in its database.  Open geospatial data can be remarkably unstable.  Data providers often seek to have the most up-to-date version of layers, meaning that historical spatial data may not continue to be hosted.  To keep our discovery tool from returning lots of broken results and to capture newly added resources, we frequently re-check data portals. \n",
