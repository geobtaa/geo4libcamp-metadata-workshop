This is a statewide polygon feature class of 100 year and 500 year flood zones as of 1986 for the unincorporated areas of Illinois as indicated on Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program (FIRM) maps and Flood Hazard Boundary maps. The statewide data layer was created by appending data from 102 county-wide Arc/Info coverages originally released on Illinois DNR GIS data CDs dated 1996. The data were digitized from paper maps. RMS values were not more than twenty feet in the original digitizing process. Mapscale: 1:6000 to 1:24,000.",
